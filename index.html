        <p title="I'm HTML Tutor">Technically, HTML is a programming language. In fact, HTML stands for <strong> Hypertext Markup Language </strong>. Whether or not  HTML is a real language is a matter of semantics, and not terribly important. ... While  <mark>HTML</mark> and <mark>CSS</mark> are declarative, most coding is computational - and it's what most other coding languages are designed for.</p>
